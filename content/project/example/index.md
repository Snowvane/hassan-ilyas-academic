title: Technological Progress, Managerial Learning, and the Investment-to-Stock Price Sensitivity
summary: |
  (with [Kevin Aretz](https://www.kevin-aretz.com/) and [Gaurav Kankanhalli](https://gauravkankanhalli.com/))

  Motivated by a real options investment framework in which managers learn about the unobservable characteristics of new production technologies from their recently installed assets and their firm’s stock price, we show that the corporate investment-to-stock price sensitivity rises with the time since a firm last acquired new capacity, proxied through its “capacity overhang.” Our results hold under various investment, employment, and Tobin’s <em>Q</em> measures, and controlling for private information in stock prices and firm financial constraints. Notably, managers learn less from the stock price when they have more private information or access to alternative outside information sources. We shed light on the <em>nature</em> of information managers extract from markets by exploiting quasi-exogenous variation in technological progress, showing that the tendency of firms with outdated capital to learn from the stock price is more pronounced when those firms are more exposed to accelerated innovation.

## Abstract
Motivated by a real options investment framework in which managers learn about the unobservable characteristics of new production technologies from their recently installed assets and their firm’s stock price, we show that the corporate investment-to-stock price sensitivity rises with the time since a firm last acquired new capacity, proxied through its “capacity overhang.” Our results hold under various investment, employment, and Tobin’s <em>Q</em> measures, and controlling for private information in stock prices and firm financial constraints. Notably, managers learn less from the stock price when they have more private information or access to alternative outside information sources. We shed light on the <em>nature</em> of information managers extract from markets by exploiting quasi-exogenous variation in technological progress, showing that the tendency of firms with outdated capital to learn from the stock price is more pronounced when those firms are more exposed to accelerated innovation.
